# Texture Viewer

![Texture Viewer](./assets/texture_viewer.png)

Texture viewer can be used to view any textures at runtime.

You can create one by simply typing the object expression in **developer console**. For example, if you typed `current.get_viewport().get_texture()`, since the return value is a texture, a texture viewer will be automatically created and updated.
